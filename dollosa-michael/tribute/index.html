          <p>
            Arya Stark is the youngest daughter and third child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Ned Stark.<br><br>

            Arya was born and raised at Winterfell. She has an older sister, Sansa, an older brother Robb, two younger brothers Bran and Rickon Stark, and a "bastard half-brother" Jon Snow.<br><br>

            Arya rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for influence and power. Instead, she believes that she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of arms, and is bored by embroidery and other "lady-like" pursuits. She takes after her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities. She is close to her "half-brother" Jon, who is also something of an outsider.

            <hr/>
          </div>
          <p>
            Arya can be a rather cold-blooded and slightly sadistic person at times, especially while confronting and killing those who are on her death list. Though she was initially apathetic but satisfied with killing Meryn Trant and Polliver, she did not attempt to hide her glee over slitting Walder Frey's throat, or the pleasure of seeing his family dying from poisoned wine she gave them. While she certainly possesses compassion and kindness, her time with The Hound and the Faceless Men have taught her to be ruthless to those who have wronged her and her family and has shown to be willing to use psychological mind games to worsen her enemies fate before killing them. This is shown when she repeated every word Polliver said to Lommy before killing him in the same exact way with Needle; gouged the eyes of Ser Meryn before stabbing him repeatedly and butchering Lord Walder's sons before serving their corpses to their father inside of a pie. <br><br>
            That being said, Arya is not completely blinded by revenge. After learning that her family has retaken Winterfell, she ultimately chooses reuniting with her loved ones over vengeance against her enemies (at least for the time being). <br><br>
            Arya seems to prefer staying out of politics. During a war meeting, planning for the Battle of King's Landing, Arya was clearly distrustful of Daenerys when she wanted northern troops to fight immediately. However, she did not actively speak out against her, preferring to let Sansa speak on her behalf. Later, instead of taking any action involving the truth about Jon's true parentage, she instead rides with the Hound to King's Landing to kill Cersei. Later, during the council meeting to elect the next monarch Arya withholds her vote for Bran since Sansa declares the North an independent kingdom and only speaks to threaten Yara when she suggests letting the unsullied keep Jon. All of this speaks to her preferring to let Sansa speak for her family on political matters and for her to focus on confronting threats to her family, friends, and herself in a more direct matter, outside of politics.

          <h2>A Game of Thrones</h2>
          <p>
            When her brothers Robb and Jon find six direwolf pups, Arya adopts one of them, whom she names Nymeria, in reference to the Rhoynish warrior-queen of the same name.<br><br>
            Arya and her sister, Sansa, travel with their father, Lord Eddard, to King's Landing when he is made Hand of the King. Before she leaves, Arya's half-brother Jon gives her a sword called Needle, after her least favorite ladylike activity, as a parting gift. He tells her she will need to practice, but that the first lesson is to "stick 'em with the pointy end". On the way south, she befriends a peasant boy named Mycah, and they often play at swords.<br><br>
            While walking near the ruby ford, Prince Joffrey Baratheon and Sansa happen upon Arya and Mycah "battling" in the woods. Arya defends Mycah from Joffrey's torments, and Nymeria helps Arya fight off Joffrey, wounding his arm in the process. Knowing that Joffrey will likely want retribution, Jory Cassel helps Arya chase the direwolf away when he finds them. Arya is brought to Darry before King Robert I Baratheon, who counsels Eddard to discipline Arya. Queen Cersei Lannister is not satisfied with this, however, and orders Sansa's direwolf, Lady, to be killed in Nymeria's place. Mycah, having fled, is tracked and killed by Joffrey's "dog," Sandor Clegane. From this moment, Arya harbors enmity for the Hound.<br><br>
            While in King's Landing, after Arya fights with Sansa, their father discovers Needle. Questioned how Arya gained possession of the sword, she refuses to give up Jon's name as the gift giver. Eddard realizes that she must be trained if she is entertaining ideas about swordsmanship, and hires Syrio Forel, a celebrated Braavosi swordsman, under whom Arya begins her training. Under his strict, but creative, tutelage, Arya learns to fight in the Braavosi water dancer style with Needle.<br><br>
            Arya spends most of her time doing balancing and swordplay exercises as Syrio instructed her. During one of these she discovers a secret passage in the Red Keep. She overhears two men, who by description seem to be Varys and Illyrio Mopatis speaking about her father, Cersei, and spies.<br><br>
            When tensions heighten in the capital, Ned intends for Sansa and Arya to return to the north via the Wind Witch. His plans are halted by the Robert's death, however, and the succession of King Joffrey I. During the purge of House Stark from the Red Keep, Ser Meryn Trant and House Lannister guards attempt to take Arya into custody, but Syrio holds off Arya's attackers with a practice sword so she can flee. Arya kills a stableboy with Needle and escapes the castle using the passage she found earlier,but Sansa is captured by the Lannisters and Septa Mordane is slain.<br><br>
            Arya cannot leave King's Landing since the city gates are heavily guarded, so she lives on the streets of Flea Bottom, catching pigeons and rats to trade for food. Arya witnesses her father's public condemnation at the Great Sept of Baelor. She is found in the crowd by Yoren of the Night's Watch, who saves her from the sight of Eddard's execution and drags her from King's Landing.<br><br>
            Cersei has Sansa send letters to Winterfell, but Arya's mother, Catelyn Stark, notices that no mention is made of Arya. Catelyn negotiates an alliance between Robb, her eldest son, and Lord Walder Frey at the Twins, and the agreement calls for Arya to wed one of Walder's sons, Elmar Frey.
          </p>

          <h2>A Clash of Kings</h2>
          <p>
            Arya escapes King's Landing with Yoren and his party of Night's Watch recruits, with Yoren planning to return her to Winterfell on his way back the Wall. Yoren shaves her head and makes Arya assume the identity of "Arry", a boy recruit traveling with Yoren to the Wall. They make it as far as a deserted town near the Gods Eye lake, where they are attacked by House Lannister raiders led by Ser Amory Lorch. Yoren is killed and Arya is one of the few to escape alive, along with Gendry, Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands, and Weasel. Before escaping the burning town, she saves the lives of three chained Night's Watch prisoners: Jaqen H'ghar, Rorge, and Biter.<br><br>
            Arya heads out with the survivors until they are captured by Ser Gregor Clegane and the Mountain's men in a village, where they are held for eight days, while the Tickler tortures the villagers. Rafford kills Lommy and Polliver takes Needle from Arya. During the journey to Harrenhal, Arya creates a prayer of those she hates and wants to kill. These include Gregor Clegane, Dunsen, Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling, the Tickler, Sandor Clegane, Amory Lorch, Ilyn Payne, Meryn Trant, Joffrey Baratheon, and Cersei Lannister.<br><br>
            At Harrenhal Arya is assigned to the steward Weese to work at the Wailing Tower. Several days later, Arya reunites with Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter, who are now in the employ of Amory. Jaqen comes to her at night and offers her three deaths for the three lives—Rorge, Biter, and himself—she saved from burning at the Gods Eye. After several days Arya names Chiswyck, after she overhears him boast at how he participated in a gang rape, and he dies three days later. Next she names Weese, for striking her. Weese's death is untraceable, apparently linked to his small dog that he raised from a pup. While trying to figure out the last name to say, Arya realizes she should have said a more important name, such as Lord Tywin Lannister or Amory Lorch. Finally, she names Jaqen himself. To make her unsay his name, Jaqen agrees to help her free Robett Glover's and Ser Aenys Frey's men in the dungeon and stage an uprising.<br><br>
            Unbeknownst to Arya, Robett is already conspiring with Vargo Hoat against Amory. During the fall of Harrenhal, Arya obtains soup which Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter then use to scald the Lannister guards. To Arya's amazement, Jaqen changes his face and manner in front of her, saying it was time for that person to die. Before departing, he gives Arya an iron coin and tells her to repeat the phrase valar morghulis to any man of Braavos.<br><br>
            The next morning, Lord Roose Bolton arrives to take charge of the castle. Arya, now calling herself "Nymeria", or "Nan" for short, is named Roose's cupbearer for her role in the freeing of the prisoners. She inadvertently meets Elmar Frey, the squire she would have to marry under Robb's agreement with the Freys, though they remain unknown to each other. Lord Bolton has Arya help him with leechings and orders her to burn his wife Walda's letter.<br><br>
            Arya asks to accompany Roose when he leaves Harrenhal, but Lord Bolton is shocked by his servant's insolence and announces she will be left behind at the castle with Vargo's Brave Companions. Arya escapes with Gendry and Hot Pie, killing a Bolton guard at the gate.<br><br>
