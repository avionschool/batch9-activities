                    <h4><i class='ion-ios-timer-outline'></i> History</h4>
                    <p>
                        Eren was born in Shiganshina District on March 30th, 835, in the southern region of Wall Maria 
                        to Carla Jaeger and Grisha Jaeger. He had a few friends, although his best friend was Armin Arlert, 
                        whom he often defended from the neighborhood bullies. Armin inspired his passion to leave the Walls and 
                        travel by showing him a hidden book about the outside world. He dreamed of joining the Survey Corps
                        as soon as he reached the enlistment age, in order to see the outside world.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class='col span-1-of-3 box'>
                    <h4><i class='ion-ios-camera-outline'></i>  Appearance</h4>
                    <p>
                        Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. His facial features strongly resembled his mother's; he had a reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray eyes. His hair was short and black, and his bangs fell in a natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular, although this was often unseen due to his relatively baggy clothing. After the four-year time skip, Eren grew his hair down to his neck.

                    <h4><i class='ion-ios-people-outline'></i>  Personality</h4>
                    <p>
                        Eren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which are attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and, eventually, his equally strong determination to escape the Walls. Even as a young child, he was so intent on joining the Survey Corps that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as "silly" and comparing them to complacent livestock.

                        There are only so many lives I can value. And I decided who those people were six years ago. So you shouldn't try to ask for my pity. Because right now, I don't have time to spare or room in my heart.

                        I don't know which option you should choose. I could never advise you on that... No matter what kind of wisdom dictates you the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it's right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice.

                        I'm leaving it all with Eren. My dream. My life. Everything. I have nothing else left to lose. I'm sure Eren will be able to reach the ocean. He'll have to see it for both of us. Because there are times people have to die.
