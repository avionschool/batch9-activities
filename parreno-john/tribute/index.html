            Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934 – December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, and science communicator.

    <span><h3> by Wyn Wachhorst as delivered by Buzz Aldrin</h3></span>

<p>I can't think of Carl without seeing that wind-blown
figure strolling on the beach, telling us, over the roar
of the breakers, in his emphatic rhythms and prophetic
style, that we stand on the shore of the cosmic ocean,
riding our wisp of blue and white like mites on a floating
leaf, in the whorls and eddies of a great galactic reef. It
was in that first episode of Cosmos, seen by 400 million
people in 60 countries, that he released to the sea breeze
the dandelion seed that became his cathedral-like "ship
of the imagination," drifting majestically among stellar
fires and mysterious worlds.</p>
<p>
That cathedral of the imagination was Carl Sagan's
signature. More than anyone of his century, he reignited
the sense of wonder in a world increasingly content to
simply exist. Wonder was the core motif in the complex
fugue of Carl's life: the six-year-old at the World Exposition, awe-struck by the utopian sights; the boy standing with outstretched arms in an open field, imploring
the magic force that had carried John Carter to that
blood-red beacon burning low in the night sky; and the
proud ship Voyager, with its pictures of man and its
heartfelt hellos from the children of Earth. Who but Carl
would cast humanity's bottle into the cosmic ocean?</p>
<p>
But it was also Carl's rare gift to walk that razor's
edge between romance and reality. He was the dreamer
and the doer, the theorist and the activist, combining his
lofty speculations with cold, hard logic, balancing his
soaring wonder with an unrelenting skepticism. It's
been said of him that "few scientists have made such
extraordinary claims" but that "fewer still have backed
them up with such extraordinary evidence."
</p>
<p> The dreamer brought to a shrinking world measureless oceans of space; the doer was arrested at a nuclear
protest. A student, suggesting that Sagan had demystified all the beliefs that make us feel worthwhile, asked
him what was left. Without pause, Carl said, "Do
something worthwhile, and then you can feel worthwhile." But the common thread, running through his
many-faceted career, was his confrontation with what
he called our "failure of nerve." The self-indulgent state
that has taken this nation from the world's largest producer and creditor to the world's largest consumer and
debtor now cycles between pseudoscientific solipsism
and existential despair, while the lone ego becomes a
cosmos unto itself.</p>
<p>
Into this new medievalism came Carl Sagan, a latterday Bruno announcing an "infinity of worlds," a
Copernicus holding that ego is not the center, a Galileo
revealing that the heavens are more than a crystalline
zodiac, that they are vast beyond imagination.</p>
<p>While the degenerate media offer epiphanies in the
form of aliens come to eviscerate cows and rape rural
housewives, the epiphany for Carl lay not in a cosmos
that comes across light-years to doodle in our wheat
fields but one to which we must make the pilgrimage,
across an infinite regression of Archimedean points,
sailing outward into ourselves. The quest, for Carl, was
not inward and backward but forward and outward.
</p>
<p>
Symbolic of both medievalism and solipsism- an
Earth turning inward upon itself- is a budget that encourages the exploitation rather than the exploration of
space. "Space exploration," Carl insisted, is not endless
circles in low orbit, tending weightless tomatoes, it is .
"going to other worlds." The continued exploration of
the solar system, he argued, is "a challenge that can bind
together nations, inspire youth, advance science, and
ultimately end our confinement to one vulnerable world."
Joseph Campbell has observed that in countless myths
from all parts of the world the quest for fire occurred
not because anyone knew what the practical uses of fire
would be but because it was fascinating. It is fitting that
those same myths credit the capture of fire with setting
man apart from the beasts, for it is the earliest sign of
that willingness to pursue fascination at great risk that
has been the signature of our species. Man requires these
fascinations, said the poet Robinson Jeffers, as "visions
that fool him out of his limits." Carl's grand vision was
of voyages on a stellar ocean teeming with life. He saw
in spaceflight, as in all science, the spiritual quest- the
sense of hope that is the heart of the human soul.</p>
<p>
A teacher of the world, a risk-taker who often stood
alone against the scientific establishment, who saw
that there can be no meaningful success without the
opportunity to fail, Carl Sagan passes into the lexicon
with the likes of Verne, Wells, Heinlein, and Bonestell,
Goddard, Oberth, and Von Braun-men who "fooled
us out of our limits," leaving us finally aware that we
live in the stars.
</p>
<p>
This was the promise of Carl Sagan's vision, that
people from Earth would one day flow into the ancient
river valleys of Mars, down the gorges three miles deep,
out over desolate, wind-torn plains, out to the ice seas
of Europa, the yellow skies of Titan, and the water
volcanoes of Enceiadus, out into the ocean of light, to
those worlds within worlds where the star-children wait.
</p>
<p>
He was, as he said of science itself, "a candle in the
dark."

    <h1>Carl Sagan, In the Valley of the Shadow (Afterlife)</h1> 
    <p>…I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But as much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert and afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
    I want to grow really old with my wife, Annie, whom I dearly love. I want to see my younger children grow up and play a role in their character and intellectual development. I want to meet still unconceived grandchildren. There are scientific problems whose outcomes I long to witness—such as the exploration of many of the worlds in our solar system and the search for life elsewhere. I want to learn how major trends in human history, both hopeful and worrisome, work themselves out: the dangers and promise of our technology, say; the emancipation of women; the growing political, economic and technological ascendancy of China; interstellar flight.
</p><p>
    If there were life after death, I might, no matter when I die, satisfy most of these deep curiosities and longings. But if death is nothing more than an endless, dreamless sleep, this is a forlorn hope. Maybe this perspective has given me a little extra motivation to stay alive.
</p><p>
    The world is so exquisite, with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there’s little good evidence. Far better, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.

    <h1>CARL SAGAN: Make the most of this life</h1>
    <p>By Gav on February 15, 2012</p>
    <p>Carl Sagan (1934-1996) was an American astronomer, cosmologist, author and the coolest nerd ever. He was famous for making science accessible to anyone with half a brain. His 1980 documentary series, Cosmos, inspired a whole generation of people and I think it’s the greatest television series ever made. I only watched it for the first time five years ago (I wish I saw it when I was 14 instead of 24), but since then I’ve devoured all of Sagan’s books and watched Cosmos again about a thousand times. His work explained so much to me: the history of the cosmos, evolution, civilisation, the beauty of science, the perils of superstition and pseudoscience, the origin of religion – basically life, the universe and everything. Carl Sagan was the teacher I never had.</p>
