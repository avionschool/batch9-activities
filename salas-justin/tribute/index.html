						Nicasio "Asiong" Rodriguez Salonga, nicknamed the "Hitler" or "Hito"
						of Tondo, was an infamous Filipino gangster whose notorious life had
						been portrayed in several movie versions in 1961 by Joseph Estrada,
						1977 by Rudy Fernandez, 1990 and 2011 both played by George Estregan
						Jr.

					<p class="bio-prag">
						Asiong was considered one of the Philippines' public enemies where
						he reigned and dominated the Manila's then-known mob district,
						Tondo, for several years. Asiong as a gang leader had 12 loyal
						members in his group, with 4 hideouts in Manila (Tondo, Binondo,
						Quiapo & Pier). Salonga's name had been linked to several illegal
						possession of firearms, selling of firearms, homicide, collection of
						sum of money from businessmen, and other unknown nefarious cases
						from which somehow he had always managed to squirm out of arrest.
					</p>
					<p class="bio-prag">
						Despite this reputation, Salonga was still considered a hero by many
						local residents, and thus earning him a nickname the "Robin Hood of
						Tondo". Asiong was recognized by many in Metro Manila due to the
						frequent appearances of his name in the headlines of the journal
						news. The only record of Salonga in the Supreme Court was dated
						March 28, 1946, which was concerned with his arrest without warrant
						on January 10 of the same year.

							He was shot dead in 1951 by one of his companions, allegedly in a
							drinking spree, Ernesto Reyes along with Joe David, which had been
							speculated as a double cross for fellow gang leader, and also
							Salonga’s rival, Carlos Capistrano (aka. Totoy Golem) whom Reyes
							worked for. Some sources also pointed politics as another angle
							behind the killing. Salonga's death occurred prior to his 27th
							birthday.
