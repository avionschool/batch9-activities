            <p><span>Dookie (1994)</span>
                I had a girlfriend named Amanda, this Cal student. I learned a lot about feminism through her. She gave me an education that I think was very timely for me. I was just a dumb kid, high school dropout. She was telling me about the way women have been objectified for so many years, and I was just listening. I wrote this as a love song to her, but it was also about learning about her activism. When it says “Scream at me until my ears bleed,” I was kind of going, “I’m here to listen.” With any kind of activism, the first thing you need to do is be a good listener. The song becomes about an understanding. That song just feels so good to sing. I’m really proud of it; it’s very stripped down, simple, three chords. It’s kind of a cult hero. It’s one of those songs that wasn’t a single, but it had a life of its own. Those are the special kinds of songs.

            <p><span>Nimrod (1997)</span>
                I wrote this back when I was writing for Dookie. It was for a girlfriend who was moving to Ecuador. I went to this house party in Berkeley, where all these college students were passing an acoustic guitar around and singing songs. a “weird dudes with ponytails and an acoustic guitar” kind of moment. I remember going, “Oh, man, I should try doing an acoustic song,” so I wrote that song about her and the end of our relationship. “Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial”. I had tattooed her name on me, and then I had to get it covered up, that’s all that was.

                It’s about trying to be cool, accepting that, in life, people go in different directions. This was a wildly different direction: I was getting ready to go on tour and promote Dookie, and had a single on the radio, and everything was starting to happen. She was moving to Ecuador to continue her studies and live with a family there. People come into your life and it’s wonderful, but they seem to go out of your life as quickly as they came in. That’s what the song’s about.

                So I wrote it in ’93 — the whole song was done, but I didn’t think it was going to be for Green Day at all. Then when we were doing Insomniac, I did a demo for it, but it wasn’t right for that album, either. I didn’t really know what to do. When we made Nimrod, I was just like, “Let’s see what happens.” We put this little string quartet on it, which was going way outside what Green Day was known for. And it was amazing. It opened up a brand-new world: “Oh, fuck, we can do so much more.”

                It took on a life of its own. I was definitely not thinking about weddings and graduations when I wrote it. A girl just sent me a message on my Instagram [saying] she had a brother that just passed away, and that became the song her family would listen to that they related to their experience. It’s really beautiful when you think about it.
