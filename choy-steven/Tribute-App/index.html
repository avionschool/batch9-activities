                    <h1>Louis Daniel Armstrong</h1>
                <p id="img-caption">
                    is one of the most important and influential musicians in jazz history. <br> He was the forefront of changing jazz from an ensemble oriented into 
                    an art of inventive solo improvisations. <br>With his raspy and scat style singing, his unique singing voice brought jazz to another level of performance.

                <h2>Musical Training while in Juvenile Detention.</h2>
                <p>
                    Armstrong spent his youth singing on the street for spare change, but he didn’t receive any formal musical training until age 11, <br>when he was arrested for firing a pistol in the street during a New Year’s Eve celebration. <br>
                    The crime earned him a stint in a detention facility called the Colored Waif’s Home for Boys, <br>
                    and it was there that Armstrong claimed, “me and music got married.”<br>
                    He spent his 18-month sentence learning how to play bugle and cornet from the Waif’s Home’s music teacher, Peter Davis, <br>and eventually became a star performer in its brass band.

                <h2>At age 62, Armstrong surpassed The Beatles at the top of the pop charts.</h2>
                <p>In late-1963, Armstrong and his All Stars recorded the title track for an upcoming musical called “Hello, Dolly!” <br>
                    The trumpeter didn’t expect much from the tune, but when the show debuted on Broadway the following year,
                    it became a runaway hit. <br>By May, “Hello Dolly!” had soared to the top of the charts, 
                    displacing two songs by The Beatles, who were then at the height of their popularity. <br>
                    At age 62, Armstrong became the oldest musician in American history to have a number one song.

                <h2 class="funfacts2">A musical marriage with Ella Fitzgerald</h2>
                <p class="funfacts2">
                    The collaborations between Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong have attracted much attention over the years.<br> 
                    The artists were both widely known icons not just in the areas of big band, jazz, and swing music but across 20th century popular music in general. <br>
                    The two African-American musicians produced three official releases together in Ella and Louis (1956), Ella and Louis Again (1957), and Porgy and Bess (1959). <br>
                    Each release earned both commercial and critical success. As well, tracks related to those albums have also appeared in various forms in multi-artist collections and other such records.

                <h2 class="funfacts2">Impact</h2>
                <p class="funfacts2">
                    Armstrong's music had such an important effect on jazz history that many scholars, critics, and fans call him the first great jazz soloist.<br>
                    More than that, with the collaboration with Fitzgerald, used their fame in support for degredation and in civil rights movements. <br>
                    It reached to a point where Armstrong boycotted performing for the late president, Eisenhower, because of a decision that was based on racism.
