				<h1>James Alan Hetfield</h1>
					<p id="tribute-info">
						<strong>James Hetfield</strong> is the legendary rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of the American thrash and heavy metal band <strong>Metallica</strong>. Known for his distinctive vocal style and iconic guitar riffs, he propelled Metallica to superstardom during the mid 80's up to the present day and inspired a lot of heavy metal bands across the world. Many young guitarists decided to pick up and play the guitar because of James and I'm one of those. His music and lyrics helped me through the good and the bad times of my life. I created this page to give tribute to the man who made a lasting impression in my life.
